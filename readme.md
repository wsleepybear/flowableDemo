# Flowable Demo Project

This project demonstrates the use of Flowable, a lightweight business process engine written in Java. The project is built with Spring Boot and Maven.

## Overview

The main functionality of this project is to create and deploy a BPMN model to the Flowable engine. The BPMN model is created dynamically based on user input, and includes various types of BPMN elements such as start events, user tasks, service tasks, and end events. The model is then deployed to the Flowable engine, and the process definition category is set.
